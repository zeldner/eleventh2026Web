Step 1:  Create React with TypeScript template
    npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
        Select a framework: React
        Select a variant: TypeScript + SWC
│       Use rolldown-vite (Experimental)?: No
│       Install with npm and start now? No
    npm install

Step 2 : Install libraries (Socket + P2P)
    npm install socket.io-client peerjs

Step 3 : create .env : 
            VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001

Step 4 : install tailwindcss 
    npm install @tailwindcss/vite@next
    in client\vite.config.ts : 
        import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
        import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
        import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite' 

        export default defineConfig({
        plugins: [
            react(),
            tailwindcss(), 
        ],
        server: {
            proxy: {
            '/api': { 
                target: 'http://localhost:3001', 
                changeOrigin: true, 
                secure: false 
            },
            }
        }
    })

    in index.css : delete everything and write : 
        @import "tailwindcss"
    
How the Google Video Chat (WebRTC) Works : 
    We are using WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) and the PeerJS library.
    Usually, data goes from user a server, and then to our friend. That’s slow. For the Video Chat, we use P2P (Peer-to-Peer).
    The Handshake: First, both students talk to our Render server just to 'find' each other’s address.
    The Direct Link: Once they find each other, they stop talking to the server and connect their cameras directly to each other.  It’s the fastest way to stream video with zero lag."

Explanation for the S-Pen/Touc:
    We used Vercel specifically because it handles Vite projects so well. Vite optimizes our drawing code so it's light enough to run smoothly even on a users phone or tablet with an S-Pen."
