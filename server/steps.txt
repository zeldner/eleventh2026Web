Step 1: Firebase Setup 
	We need a "Service Account Key" to let our Node server talk to Firebase.
	Go to the Firebase Console.
	Create a project 
	Go to Project Settings (Gear icon) -> Service accounts.
	Click Generate new private key.
	A file will download. Rename it to serviceAccountKey.json.
	Keep this file ready. We will move it into the server folder soon.
	Go to Firestore Database in the left menu -> Create Database -> Start in Test Mode

Step 2 : Install Dependencies
	npm init -y

Step 3 :  Install logic libraries
	npm install express cors socket.io firebase-admin

Step 4 : Install TypeScript and Types (Dev Dependencies)
	npm install -D typescript ts-node @types/node @types express @types/cors

Step 5 :  Generate tsconfig.json
	npx tsc --init

Step 6 : install dotenv
	npm install dotenv
	add .env : 
		PORT = 3001
		CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173 

Step 7 : Config Change (tsconfig.json): 
	Open tsconfig.json and replace the entire content with : 

	{
  		// Visit https://aka.ms/tsconfig to read more about this file
  		"compilerOptions": {
    		/* Basic Options */
    		"target": "es2016", /* Modern enough for Node.js LTS */
    		"module": "commonjs", /* We use commonjs in Node.js */
    		"rootDir": "./src" /* Where your source code is located */,
    		"outDir": "./dist" /* Where the compiled code goes */,

    		/* Critical settings for JSON and libraries */
    		"esModuleInterop": true /* Allows importing commonjs modules */,
    		"resolveJsonModule": true /* For options stored in JSON files */,
    		"strict": true, /* for : all strict type-checking options */
    		"skipLibCheck": true, /* Skip type checking of declaration files */
    		"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true /* Disallow inconsistently-cased references to the same file */
  		}
	}

Step 8: The Server Code (server/src/index.ts): 
	Create a src folder, and inside it index.ts 

Step 9 : Install Nodemon
	npm install -D nodemon
	in package.json : 
		scripts": {
  			"dev": "nodemon src/index.ts" 
		}
	"If" Nodemon doing problem with index.ts file:
		 create file server/nodemon.json :
		 	{
  				"watch": ["src"],
  				"ext": "ts,json",
  				"exec": "ts-node src/index.ts"
			}

npm install peer


(The "Mirror" Technique)
The Concept: Normally, browsers block a website (Vercel) from talking to a different server (Render) for security. This is called CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

We built a Smart Mirror. When our browser knocks on our server's door, the server looks at the 'Passport' (the Origin header), sees it's our Vercel site, and immediately mirrors that name back to the guard saying, 'Yes, this is allowed!' This way, the server works for our local computers and the live website at the same time without us changing the code."

How the "Ping" Works (The "Espresso Shot")
The Concept: Free servers like Render go to "sleep" after 15 minutes of inactivity to save electricity. When the first user  joins, they have to wait 30 seconds for the server to "wake up," which looks like a bug.

"Our server is on a free plan, so it likes to take naps. To keep it awake , we programmed a Self-Ping. Every 13 minutes, the server actually sends a 'text message' to itself. Because it stays 'busy' talking to itself, it never naps, and it’s always ready for us to draw on the board instantly."
